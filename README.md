# RijksMuseum

## Install

* Install [Swiftlint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) on your machine
* Check SPM chaces first
* Build and run

## App Structure

* I used **MVVM** with a simple router and observation with only UIKit, no Combine.

* I used SwiftFormat and SwiftLint to enhance Swift style.

* I used **SPM** (Swift Package Manager) only for *SnapKit*.

* I used Sourcery to create most of the Mocks for the Unit Test.
